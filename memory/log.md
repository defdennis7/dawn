# Edit Log

*This log records all AI-generated edits, providing a sequential history of changes with timestamps and descriptions. Each change is marked with an edit number, used for tracking modifications and additions in `context.md`.*

## System Parameters for AI Memory Regain
- **Review Application Changes**: Always check for recent edits and changes logged in `log.md` and reflect them in `context.md`.
- **Sequential Edit Tracking**: Each new edit is numbered based on the last recorded edit number in this file. The AI should use these edit numbers to update `context.md` and maintain continuity.
- **Log Structure Compliance**: Ensure each log entry follows the structured format below for consistency.
